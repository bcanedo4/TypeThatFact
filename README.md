# TypeThatFact

An application built with HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript that calculates how fast the user types. It accomplishes this by fetching a random fact from Random Useless Facts (https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/) and prompts the user to type it. 

## Prequisites 

### live-server
Download live-server onto your computer by running this command on your terminal. 
```
npm i live-server -g
```

### ngrok (Mobile view)
If you'd like to view the project on a phone or tablet, you can use ngrok. Ngrok only needs to be downloaded on a desktop, not on the phone tablet itself. If you don't already have it downloaded, follow the directions on their website: https://ngrok.com/download

## Getting Started

1. Download or clone the project.

2. Run ```npm i``` to download the project's dependencies.

3. Run the command ```live-server``` in the root of the project directory.

4. You should be navigated to http://127.0.0.1:8080 with the project working!

## Getting Started on Mobile View

1. Perform all of the steps under "Getting Started".

2. While live-server is running, open a new tab on your terminal and run this command: ```ngrok http 127.0.0.1:8080``` (or whatever url live-server is hosting on).

3. Follow the link to the right of where it says "Forwarding" on your phone. That should do it! The project should be up and running on your device.
