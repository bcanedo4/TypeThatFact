# TypeThatFact

An application built with HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript that calculates how fast the user types. It accomplishes this by fetching a random fact from Random Useless Facts (https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/) and prompts the user to type it. 

## Prequisites 

Download live-server onto your computer by running this command on your terminal. 
```
npm i live-server -g
```

## Getting Started

1. Download or clone the project.

2. Run the command ```live-server``` in the root of the project directory.

3. You should be navigated to http://127.0.0.1:8080 with the project working!
